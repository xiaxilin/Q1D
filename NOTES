Explicit Solver:
Some problems with coarse grid convergence... 
could just be a van Leer FVS dissipation problem, but need to analyze

Implicit Solver:
Does not converge if mref > 1.0... once again could be van Leer FVS
Need to check a linear starting solution.
Need to add CFL ramping.
Need to nondimensionalize, the matrix structure for the flux Jacobians is:

Row 1: O(1)
Row 2: O(100)
Row 3: O(100000)

This is not good for the numerics... will most likely nondim. on STP conditions.
