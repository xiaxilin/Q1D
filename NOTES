Explicit Solver:
Does not converge if mref < 1.0, 
velocity is allowed to go negative which could be the problem.
Some problems with coarse grid convergence... 
could just be a van Leer FVS dissipation problem, but need to analyze

Implicit Solver:
Dividing through by cell_vol seems to have fixed CFL stability problem,
still need to revisit time step definition.
Can ramp/jump from low cfl to over 100 now.
Need to nondimensionalize, the matrix structure for the flux Jacobians is:

Row 1: O(1)
Row 2: O(100)
Row 3: O(100000)

This is not good for the numerics... will most likely nondim. on STP conditions.

TODO:
Need to check a linear starting solution.
Need to add CFL ramping.
Need to create cell_vol vector rather than constantly recalculating it
Need to move source_jac calculation to jacobians.f90
Need to create Roe LHS... although Q1D does run with van Leer LHS and Roe RHS
